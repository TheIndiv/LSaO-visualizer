# LSaO Visualiser
**L**inear **S**pectrum **a**nd **O**scilloscope Visualizer is an extremely fast audio visualization tool

by [Aaron F. Bianchi](mailto:aaronf.bianchi@gmail.com) 

This tool that can export videos of a linear spectrum, tuned short waveform, long waveform or stereo oscilloscope of a song.  It supports multiple audio and video formats.

Written to output videos that look as **violent**, **responsive**, **snappy** and **rough** as possible. It draws a white linear spectrum, waveform or oscilloscope over a black background for further processing with a video editor of your preference.

Why?
---------------------
This small project started due to the omnipresence of logarithmic spectrum visualizers and the apparent absence of linear spectrum visualizers (apart from the one in After Effects). Once I made this, I decided to also include the other three types of visualizers.
