This is an audio visualization tool that can export videos of a linear spectrum, tuned short waveform, long waveform or stereo oscilloscope of a song.  It supports multiple audio and video formats.

Written to output videos that look as violent, responsive, snappy and rough as possible. It draws a white linear spectrum, waveform or oscilloscope over a black background for further processing with a video editor of your preference.
